## Pre-requisites

We only need two environment variables to get setup and start using the application.

### .env.example

```
DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=
```

`DATABASE_URL` We can get this from neon after signing up and creating a new project

`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` This will be the live deployed URL when the application is deployed. For local testing just need to have it as `http://localhost:3000`
